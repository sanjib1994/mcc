    <string name="bmi_info_notice">The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from weight in kilograms and height in metres. (Refer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index).</string>
    <string name="bp_info_notice">Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels and is one of the principal vital signs. A person’s blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic (maximum) pressure over diastolic (minimum) pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal resting blood pressure for an adult is approximately 120/80 mm Hg. (Refer: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbp)</string>
    <string name="bs_info_notice">The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis. Many factors affect a person blood sugar level. (Refer: http://www.joslin.org/info/Goals-for-Blood-Glucose-Control.html)</string>
    <string name="sa_info_notice">Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings.

    <string name="The_optimal_timing">The optimal timing and duration of sleep depends on each individual’s sleep needs, schedule, and internal biological rhythm. The amount of sleep needed changes across your lifespan, but for adults (18 years or older) it is suggested to get 7 to 9-hours of sleep per night. Please consult a doctor for sleep and health advice.</string>

    <!--FAQs Sub-->
    <string name="There_is_no_one_exact">There is no one exact time that you should or should not exercise. Here is some information you may want to keep in mind when you determine when and how much you plan to exercise:\n\n• There is a sharp rise in heart rate in the early morning (~6:45 am, this time will vary based on schedule) due to a peak in cortisol to help you wake up.\n\n• Muscles have the best coordination in the afternoon around 2:30 pm.\n\n• Muscles have the fastest reaction time around 3:30pm.\n\n• Cardiovascular efficiency and muscle strength is greatest around 5pm.\n\n• Blood pressure is highest around 6pm.\n\n• Exercise arouses the brain, so it is good to stop vigorous activity a few hours before you plan to sleep.</string>
    <string name="You_should_consult">You should consult a doctor about intensity, duration, frequency, and types of exercise that are best for you.\n\n The American Heart Association Recommendations are below.\n\nFor Overall Cardiovascular Health:\n\n• At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days per week for a total of 150\n\nOR\n\n• At least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days per week for a total of 75 minutes; or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity\n\nAND\n\n• Moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week for additional health benefits.\n\nFor Lowering Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:\n\n• An average 40 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic activity 3 or 4 times per week</string>
    <string name="We_do_not_provide">We do not provide specific goals for eating, sleeping, or activity. It is up to you to determine goals that you feel are best for your health and your lifestyle.\n\nOur research in animal models has shown that eating and drinking within an 8 to 12-hour interval has a wide variety of health benefits. Another way of thinking about this is that your body needs to fast for ~12 to 16-hours per day. We do not yet know the exact eating interval that is needed to see the full effects in humans. In preliminary trials in humans, health benefits were observed when eating was restricted to a 10 to 11-hour eating/drinking interval per day.\n\nYour chosen eating interval should also take into account your baseline eating interval. For example, if you are currently eating over a 16-hour interval, you would likely see benefits from switching to a 12-hour interval. If you are already eating between a 12 or 13-hour interval, you may need to switch to a 10 or 11-hour eating interval goal to see health benefits.\n\nFor more information about research from our lab and others, please see the blog and science sections on our website, www.mycircadianclock.org. </string>
    <string name="A_majority_of_research">A majority of research on time-restricted feeding has been done in flies and mice. We have also run preliminary studies in humans. Potential benefits include:\n\n• Weight loss\n• Decreased cholesterol\n• Decreased blood pressure\n• Decreased blood sugar\n• Decreased A1c\n• Better sleep quality\n• Increased Alertness\n• Increased Endurance\n• Decreased body fat</string>
    <string name="healthy_lifestyle">Yes. A healthy lifestyle is determined by when, what, and how much you eat, sleep, and move. Timing of caloric intake is only one of those components. When you eat is a very important aspect that is frequently ignored. If all you change is the timing of your food, it should still have a beneficial effect, but it would be optimal to eat healthy proportions and quality of food. For example, in mice, we found that mice on an 8 to 12-hour eating interval did not gain weight when put on a high fat diet. However, mice that stuck to an 8 to 12-hour eating interval on normal diet were still healthier than the mice on the high fat diet. </string>
    <string name="start_stop_times">Determine the start and stop times of your eating and drinking that best fit your schedule. The exact times vary greatly depending on the individual. It is a good idea to not eat or work out too close to when you plan on falling asleep, but aside from that, figure out what works for you and do your best to stick to it. You can update your target interval and timing at any time. \n\nExample: If you were to set a goal of a 11-hour eating interval, and your first drink or sip (of anything but water and medicine) was at 7am, then your last drink or sip would be at or before 6pm. After 6pm, you would only be able to have water and medications. This schedule would allow for an 11-hour feeding interval and a 12-hour fasting interval.</string>
    <string name="Your_body_digests">Your body digests food differently throughout the day due to biological rhythms in your digestive system. Your liver is best at processing high calorie foods in the first half of the day. Therefore, when you eat a large meal or dessert late in the day, not only is your liver not capable to digesting it well, but it is also likely that you will not be very active until the next day. Eating higher calorie meals in the first half of the day allows your body to digest the food better and gives you time to use those calories with your daily activity.</string>
    <string name="In_order_to">In order to obtain sufficient data, we ask that you use the app for a total of 14 weeks. The first two weeks are a baseline period in which time you will start using the app to log your current eating, sleeping, and activity patterns. At the end of the baseline period, you will receive a report that summarizes your lifestyle. Throughout the next 12 weeks of the study, you will continue to document your daily behaviors, but you can also set your own goals for timing of eating and sleeping. You will be able to view your history anytime through the app.\n\nEating within an 8 to 12-hour interval is part of a healthy lifestyle and should continue through your life. You are more than welcome to continue to use the app beyond 14 weeks. 14 weeks is a short amount of time that is still sufficient to see most benefits and get usable data. </string>
    <string name="Data_from_Google">Data from Google Fit or the Apple Health Kit are automatically synced with the myCircadianClock app. If you have another device, such as a smartwatch or activity tracker, simply sync it with Google Fit or Apple Health Kit and the information will automatically be synced with the mycircadianclock app. \n\nFitbit does not currently sync with Google Fit or the Apple Health Kit. There is an app called Sync Solver that will sync data from Fitbit with the Apple Health Kit, but does not sync it to Google Fit. We have no affiliation with Sync Solver and do not endorse the use of their app. </string>
    <string name="offline_app">Yes, you can use the app offline, but you won’t be able to view the Feedogram or history in offline mode.</string>
    <string name="You_can_type_annotation">You can type in the annotation (excluding quantity) in the text box. After you press the \'return\' button, it is added to the list below the entry box. You can type another food name to describe everything on your plate. Every food item you type is saved in a list above the text entry box. Within a few days, the food items you frequently eat will be displayed on the top of the list, so you can just tap on those names to describe what you ate or drank.</string>
    <string name="send_multiple_food">Yes, you can send multiple food items at a time. See “How do I log what I eat or drink?” for more information.</string>
    <string name="caffeine_counts">Yes, caffeine counts, as it can affect your metabolism.</string>
    <string name="delete_annotation">If you want to delete an annotation, simply long-press the item in the list area (above the text entry field, not below) and you will be prompted to delete that item.</string>
    <string name="item_saved">Once an item is saved, it cannot be deleted or altered. We do expect a certain level of recording error, so don’t panic if you saved something by mistake or with incorrect information. Just double check future entries before saving.</string>
    <string name="send_data">Yes, you can always send data after the fact, so if you forget to take photos or record something, don’t worry. Send according to the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Go to the main photo screen and click on plus icon at the bottom of your screen. \n\nStep 2: Add new annotations in the Enter Annotation field or select from the available list of items.\n\nStep 3: Select how long ago you had this item.\n\nStep 4: Click on Send button. The same process can be used to record medicines and water, just select the appropriate category at the top of the annotation screen.</string>
    <string name="baseline_period">At the end of your 14-day baseline period, you can review what, when, and how much you ate in the “feedogram” tab. You may also review your sleeping patterns, exercise, and daily step counts as sensed by the phone. After reviewing your own data on daily pattern of activity, sleep and food, you may decide to change these daily behaviors. We call this self-selected daily behavior changes as intervention. We would like to see if knowing your own daily habits of food, sleep and activity and how they affect your health will encourage you to change these patterns. It is entirely up to you to make any change or just continue with your current daily routine. In the subsequent 12 weeks, you will know if you made any lasting change and whether it had any impact on your health. Some changes may be as simple as taking your supplements/medications at the right time, walking a few hundred steps extra, avoiding late night eating, or sleeping an extra 15min.\n\nResearch in animal models has shown eating within a shorter window of 8-12 hours every day can reduce body fat, improve sleep, and may have many health benefits. You can set an eating window during which you wish to eat by clicking on the “Set Target button” in the Feedogram tab. The target window is shown within a yellow box on the Feedogram and a blue bar below it. To see previous week’s eating window summary, tap on the “History” button. Water and medications/supplements are not considered as food/beverages, so you may continue to drink water and take your supplement/medications as suggested by your physician or pharmacist.</string>
    <string name="feedogram_timeline">A feedogram is a timeline of all food, beverages, water, medicines/supplements you have recorded. The green marks represent food and beverages, red represents water, and orange represents medication/supplements. This snapshot is an easy display of when and what we put into our stomach. Touching any of these marks also shows you the items. Below the “feedogram” is a horizontal green bar showing the average time window in which you typically eat all your food and beverages during weekdays. The orange bar below it shows the eating window during the weekend. Research has shown eating within a shorter window of 8-12 hours every day can reduce body fat, improve sleep and may have many health benefits. You can set an eating window during which you wish to eat by clicking on the “Set Target button”. The target window is shown within a yellow box on the Feedogram and a blue bar below it. To see previous week’s eating window summary, tap on the “History” button. Water and medications/supplements are not considered as food/beverages, so you may continue to drink water and take your supplement/medications as suggested by your physician or pharmacist.</string>
    <string name="feedogram_will_become_available">The feedogram will become available at the end of your 14-day baseline period. Once it appears, you can review your eating patterns and select a target interval during which you may try to eat all your food and beverages.</string>
    <string name="Feedogram_menu">When you will click on the Feedogram menu you will find different colored marks on it. These represent different food types. If you have logged an item of “Food”/“Beverage” type you will find a red circle on the Feedogram. If you have logged “Medicine/supplement” it will be orange, and if you logged “Water” you will find blue water droplet.</string>
    <string name="sleep_goals">You can set sleep goals on the settings page. You can enter your goal \'start\' time and total duration of sleep.</string>
